## 3. Sprint review

### 3.1 Completed tasks in overall

We have managed to get a functional algorithm to work for benefit application. Also preliminary draft of UI is done. Backend has been coded. 

### 3.2 Incompleted tasks in overall (and reasons why)

There are known issues to get backend and PostgreSQL database to work in every workstation, despite them being dockerized. Known issues have been some docker's configuration in individual workstations and Java with Gradle version [PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK IF THIS STATEMENT IS CORRECT].

### 3.3 Review notes

Notes from the Wednesday's sprint review meeting (5.2.2025), icluding feedback from product owner, representives and stakeholders:
* simple codes, which everyone understands, **is better than** new technologies and / or libraries, that are out of function after a year.
* more..
* more..
* more..
